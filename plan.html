  <h1>CP1406/CP5638 - Assignment 1 - Project Plan</h1>
  <p><strong>Name:</strong> Sugut Isaac Kipkemboi</p>
  <h2>Goal</h2>
  <p>The primary goal of the 100SMILES Dental Care website is to <strong>increase the number of new patient bookings by 25% within six months of launch</strong>, specifically by converting website visitors into contacting the clinic. The site is needed to establish a modern, trustworthy online presence that clearly communicates the practice's services, expertise, and special offers, thereby moving potential patients from consideration to action. It benefits the client by directly supporting business growth and filling appointment slots.</p>
  <h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
  <p>Success will be evaluated by quantitatively measuring the conversion rate of website visitors into actionable contacts. This will be done by:
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Phone Call Tracking:</strong> Using a unique phone number on the website to track calls originating from it.</li>
        <li><strong>Email Conversion Tracking:</strong> Monitoring the volume of emails sent to `admin@100smilesdentalcare.com.au` that specifically mention the website's promotional offers (e.g., "First Visit Discount").</li>
        <li><strong>Online Booking Form Submissions:</strong> If an online booking form is implemented on the site, the number of submissions will be the primary metric.</li>
    </ol>
    The 25% increase in new patient bookings will be calculated by comparing the average monthly new patients from the six months prior to the website launch to the six months following it.
</p>
  <h2>Target Audience</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>1. Target Audience:</strong> The primary target audience is <strong>families and health-conscious adults aged 25-55</strong> living in and around Razole, Queensland. This group is typically responsible for their own and their children's healthcare decisions, values reliability and trust in service providers, and uses the internet to research local businesses. They are not looking for emergency dental solutions but for a long-term, trustworthy family dentist.

    <br><br>
    <strong>2. Design Catering:</strong> To specifically cater to this audience, the site will be designed to:
    <ul>
        <li>Emphasize <strong>trust and professionalism</strong> through clean design, high-quality images of the staff and clinic, and clear display of credentials and experience.</li>
        <li>Highlight <strong>family-friendly services</strong> with content that addresses all age groups, from children's first visits to adult preventative care.</li>
        <li>Feature the <strong>local community connection</strong> (e.g., "Serving Razole for over 30 years") to build rapport with local residents.</li>
        <li>Ensure the site is <strong>easy to navigate on mobile devices</strong>, as this demographic heavily uses smartphones to find local services.</li>
        <li>Use clear, <strong>action-oriented language</strong> (Calls-to-Action) like "Book Your Family's Check-up" and prominently display the special offers (20% off first visit) to incentivize immediate contact.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
  <h2>Site Flowchart</h2>
  <img src="Images/site_flowchart.drawio.png" alt="site flowchart">
  <p>The site will consist of three main pages: a Homepage (index.html), a Services page, and a Meet the Team page. The flowchart will show index.html as the root, with two-way navigation between all pages.</p>
